Hello there.
I didn't see you.
It does not matter. To ensure that Odd_articles works, you must have the following files: noa.txt,facts.txt, and, of course,
odd_aritcles.

To start the program, double click the file with the left mouse button.

Odd_articles will have an extended name, for example, odd_articles v1.4w.
Here is the list of commands for version 1.4w*:
Again - shows you another random wikihow article.
Quit - ends the program.
Add - allows you to add another article to the custom database.
Search(v1.4we) - allows you to search for keywords and will return a list of articles with the keyword you searched.

*Those that can work in in v1.4w but cannot function in previous versions will be marked with "v1.4we"
